# Neo Trinkey Utils

Examples of code I'm using with my Neo Trinkey devices (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4870) from Adafruit

Note that the serial example is heavily inspired by Dave Parkers serial example https://github.com/daveparker/neotrinkey but I just
simplified the serial protocol a bit to take just led and rgb hex values such as ``1234:ffffff`` across the wire as bandwidth isn't
too much of a concern and allows more flexibility.
